# Sales Analysis with Tableau and TubPy_Thesis Project
A thesis project for Business Informatics BSc. The project visualizes sales data from 2007-2009 and explores Python integration into Tableau using TabPy Server. It includes three dashboards with varying levels of detail:
- Overall Picture: for managers and supervisors;
- Discount Impact Analysis: for further analysis and strategy development; 
- Batch Analysis: for finding insights in real time (with the use of TabPy).

**To see the Dashboard 3 (Real-Time Sales Insights) the TabPy extention must be set!**

To simulate a data flow for implementing the batch approach, a *.py* file can be used.
The following dataset was used for visualization: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanuthakurr/cleaned-contoso-dataset/data.
During the project's implementation the original data was modified to correspond the task.
